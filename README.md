# Evolution Simulator in Unity3D

Genetic algorithms belong to the field of computer science and are a method of searching for optimal solutions in systems that can be described as a mathematical problem. They are useful in problems that contain many parameters and there is no analytical method that can find the optimal combination of values for the variables so that the system in question reacts as much as possible in the desired way.

Tools that were used:
- Blender 3D
- Visual Studio
- Unity3D

Finite State Machines, NavMesh, GOAP and Behavior Designer logics were applied for the AI agents.

Note that the user navigation in the project followed the logic of RTS games.

1. ASWD - Navigation
2. Mouse - Navigation and selection in space

## Description

The software development objective took part in the implementation of genetic algorithms at the synchronous and asynchronous level. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and search algorithms were applied to 3D environments where they enabled the following functions:

- Features for each agent
- The choice of mutations of these characteristics at a synchronous or asynchronous level
- The monitoring of the above in graphs
- The influence of the environment towards the agents

Below a few images showcasing how the project looks and works:

For starters the application starts from a main menu in which the user can change the settings, or choose to start / end the application.
